Edited tests.h, tests.c, alarm-wait.c
Created alarm-mega.ck

In the tests.h file I added the external method for test_alarm_mega
In the tests.c file I added we added text "alarm-mega" and the method call test_alarm_mega
In the alarm-wait.c file I added the wait function, so it would give me 70 interations of alarms
Created the file alarm-mega.ck which is the same as the alarm-multiple.ck execpt for 7 in check_alarm it says 70
